      <h1><b>How does this product work?</b></h1>
        <p>
          The product uses a BBC microbit and microbit website to code. THe microbit can detect light and when a certain light level is approched the microbit sends a signal to a servo to turn. The servo acts as a 
          light switch so when the servo is turned it turns on the LED. 
          Down Below is a picture of what the Microbit looks like when set up with the servo and LED. I have a breadboard option as well, and There is also the Microbit code.
