      <h1><b>The Harmful Effects of Computer Use</b></h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Using computers will always use electricity whether you like it or not</li>
        <li>How we get electricity is affecting the environment</li>
        <li>Most Electricity is acquired by burning fossil fuels or coal.</li>
        <li>Burning fossil fuels and coa produces greenhouse gasses</li>
        <li>Greenhouse gasses are bad for the environment </li>
      </ul>
        <h1><b>How Making Computers Deteriates Our Enviornment</b></h1>
        <ul>
          <li>When we create computers that requires resources</li>
          <li>For some reason computers require a lot of natural resources like water, and raw materials like lead, mercury, and cadmium. </li>
          <li>190,000L of water is used to create one Laptop</li>
          <li>Not only is that a considerable water amount of water that could be used for drinking, but as well as drinking water for other animals for example a cow.</li>
          <li>Mining for the metals required to create a computer creates greenhouse gasses that affect the environment </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Why Disposing Computers is Horrible For The Enviornment, and The Impact</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>What Canada does with garbage is throw them in the landfill and burn the garbage</li>
          <li>Computers contain dangerous metals like lead, mercury and cadmium. </li>
