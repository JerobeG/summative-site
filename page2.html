      <h1><b>Why Did I create this Product?</b></h1>
        <p><center>
          The first inspiration towards this website was myself. Whenever I went to sleep I constantly found myself watching youtube during the dark and way past my bedtime. I then realized how common this is and later 
          researched about the effects of watching your electronics during the dark, and boy oh boy they were not good. Watching electronics in the dark is so common yet harmful for your eyes therefore this product was
          made to be a healthy way to be watching those cute cat videos late at night without hurting your eyes.
